# The default i18n properties. This file will be searched for keys if they
# are not found anywhere else.
#
# It is always called i18n.properties (and language varients). It is always
# at the root of your resources. There may only be one per app.
#
# Do NOT use this file just because it is easy. You should normally keep your 
# I18n resources along with the content they are associated with (e.g an HTML
# resource has a .properties in the same path and with the same name prefix). 
#
# Only use this for genuinely global messages that may appear anywhere in
# your app.
